NeoGram is Powerd by [ESP8266-12E Module](Documents/ESP12E-Datasheet.pdf) which is encapsulates <b>Tensilica L106</b> integrates industry-leading ultra low power 32-bit MCU micro, with the 16-bit short mode,
Clock speed support 80 MHz, 160 MHz, supports the RTOS, integrated Wi-Fi MAC/BB/RF/PA/LNA, on-board antenna.

The module supports standard IEEE802.11 b/g/n agreement, complete TCP/IP protocol stack. Users can use the
add modules to an existing device networking, or building a separate network controller.

[WS2812B](Documents/WS2812B.pdf) is a intelligent control LED light source that the control circuit and RGB chip are integrated in
a package of 5050 components. It internal include intelligent digital port data latch and signal reshaping ampli
fication drive circuit. Also include a precision internal oscillator and a 12V voltage programmable constant curr
e-nt control part, effectively ensuring the pixel point light color height consisten.

The 12 of the  WS2812B can be progarmme indvidualy as maker wish to make there project colorfull.
